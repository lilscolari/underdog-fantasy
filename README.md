# underdog-fantasy
This is a repository where I will keep files I use for analyzing NBA players and how they are performing in terms of fantasy points.


TODO: 
- Tweak some things
- Clean up code
- Make it so you can select date ranges
- Put it on a website so you could query the DF for players?
- Expand by adding more stats?
- Compare the player's performance to their expected performance?
- Apply ML algorithms?
- Clean repo
- Add comments
- Look into auto pulling stats, concurrency, idk?
